Targets for TINYAPP: handling sessions and user authentication:
users need to be limited in which routes they can access. users without a username will only be allowed to visit the '/' home route and the registration route. 
users with a  username will be allowed to access the the login route as well as the above but nothing else.
the header should not display the logout button if the user is not logged in.
the header should not display the login form if the user is logged in or has a user name.
make sure user date is not stored in cookies
encrypt passwords.
add captchas
create two factor authentication controls.
